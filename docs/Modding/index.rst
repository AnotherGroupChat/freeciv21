Modding

Modding
  The Modding category is an area for documentation editors to provide tips and other details on modifying
  aspects of Freeciv21 such as Rulesets, Musicsets, Soundsets and Tilesets. All of these areas allow for a
  large amount of varyability in game play that is not hardcoded in the software. This is one of the 
  strengths of Freeciv21.
